# Blood on the Clocktower Bot

This is an unofficial discord bot that aids in the operation of Blood on the Clocktower games. Unlike other games, this one allows players to communicate with each other using text. This bot makes it easier for storytellers to set up private channels, receive nominations and votes, and transition between the day and night phases.
