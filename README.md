Create rooms with command '&create room @user1 @user2'
Currently the room limit of adding user if 3, which is editable in constants.js
Check the constants and update them accordingly
For starting point, code creates role automatic for each channel name
Sometimes code gives error, just restart it once, happens when creating roles for the first time

Have Fun :)
